            <p>The game plan in the series is to showcase some different things I have learned either in school or in an internship and what I was surprised that I had learned and what I had not learned</p>
            <p>to get a better understanding of this (and so I don't have to constantly repeat myself) I first want to go into one of my favorite topics,</p>
            <h2 id="me">Me</h2>
            <p>At the time of writing this I am wrapping up my junior year in college. I am looking to obtain a BS. in Computer Science with minors in Mathematics (General) and Data Analytics. My computer science track is technically called General but I
                have focused my course structure to ensure that I take as many classes as possible that cover software development topics.</p>
            <h3 id="jake-the-student">Jake the Student</h3>
            <p>As I mentioned I'm in my junior year. Like most college students I would like to assume that pretty good students. My grades are good, I hand things in on time and participate in the class room. Since I have started college I have missed 2
                lectures, one Database class (my appendix was about to burst) and one music class (stomach illness). This beng said some of the others in my class do consider atypical or particularly good at coding, I disagree with that I believe that
                I just tend to put a little more time in.</p>
            <h3 id="jake-the-intern">Jake the Intern</h3>
            <p>I work at a midsize software development firm near my university, while this is not google it is highly respected and as far as I can tell they do things properly like everyone else. The company tends to work on the Microsoft tech stack, this
                means that we mostly use Windows, C#, and javascript, we also tend to use AngularJS when we have to use a front end library.</p>
            <h3 id="jake-outside-of-the-classroom">Jake outside of the classroom</h3>
            <p>Like most students I believe that being involved doesn't stop at the end of the school day. I am an RA (Resident Advisor), maintain a work-study, and I also tutor.</p>
            <h4 id="ra">RA</h4>
            <p>I've been an RA for 4 semesters and I am planning on continuing for another 2 semesters. The RA position mostly entails me looking out for the residents that have been placed in my care. I tend to be the RA that looks out for mental issues
                anywhere from homesickness to depression. In my role as an RA, I am forced to interact with people that are different than me, wether that be co-workers or residents. It really has made me a more social creature and that is a very useful
                skill to have.</p>
            <h4 id="work-study">Work-study</h4>
            <p>Ok so this may be shocking but I really like technology. I have a work-study as a computer lab tech. In this position I get to battle against the windows operating system to update, maintain and clean nearly 75 computers between 2 technicians.
                This is not my first IT-esc position, in fact I have worked in the field since I was 15 years old. This is the first position where I am in charge. I have one person working under me (maybe 2 possible 3 starting next fall). This position
                has really taught me how to lead, how to document and how to communicate instructions to team members</p>
            <h4 id="tutoring">Tutoring</h4>
            <p>I tutor a variety of programing classes, mostly intro to intermediate. These class cover C++, Java, Python and SQL and run every semester or every-other semester this forces me to recall and reinforce what I have learned in these classes and
                I believe makes me a better programmer in general.</p>

        <button class="bubble text" id="cms">
            <h1 id="what-the-heck-is-a-cms">What the heck is a CMS</h1>
            <p>One of my first tasks at my internship was to learn Umbraco. That was really all that I was told, I was a little scared and very much confused by it.</p>
            <h2 id="umbraco"><a href="https://umbraco.com/">Umbraco</a></h2>
            <p>Umbraco is a CMS or rather a Content Management System, built using C#, Windows and Razor templates. It allows you to make reusable html (technical Razor but I digress) snippets that can interlace variables into it to customize the displays
                for specific pages. One great instance of this is for something akin to blogs, you can make a blog template that has a header some pictures and maybe some resources links and have umbraco fill int the rest.</p>
            <p>Umbraco also adds a web interface to manipulate the server in real time. This has lead to one of my new favorite games. Whenever I am on a professional website one of my new favorite things is to type /umbraco to the main url just to see if
                they are using the application.</p>
            <p>Umbraco has a ton of really really good training materials, If you need to learn how to use this specific CMS I really believe that it is te way to do it. I sat down and tried to run umbraco on my own systems to possibly host a website for
                myself using the resources that were provided I did manage to build a pretty ok local site but when I got down to business and tried to procure a server and everything set stuff up.</p>
            <p>This is where I encountered my first issue. I know how to set up websites on linux I've done it many times before for local sites and I have a plethora reading to back me up. However if you give me a windows server, I am lost as all hell,
                i couldn't put it together and becuase umbraco only runs on Windows I had to find another solution.</p>
            <h2 id="django"><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a></h2>
            <p>I love python, it works great on any operating systems and writing code in it is like poetry, thats a bit of a tangent though. Django is a python centered site hosting tools. One of those tools is a fantastic cms system what I love about this
                system is that anything I can do with umbraco I can also do with Django, for me I can do it faster but thats just because of preference. This CMS has really become my go to for larger scale applications. While I have become more interested
                in ai and machine learning I have heard that it may be a solid platform for deploying those kinds of applications, I have not done so.</p>
            <p>While these are the two CMS's that I generally use I was curious to see what other options their so I did some research and I'll just tell you what they are the basics of them.</p>
            <h2 id="strapi"><a href="https://strapi.io/">Strapi</a></h2>
            <p>Strapi runs on Node which means you are writing in javascript, this can be a great advantage for the average web developer as that means you only have to write in one language. It does make it easier to integrate the larger front end frameworks
                into your site. I attempted to use Strapi for this application but it was also a school project and I didn't want to make this any more complicated than it already is.</p>
            <h2 id="webflow"><a href="https://webflow.com/">Webflow</a></h2>
            <p>Webflow provides a graphical front end in order to generate their templates and that can make things a lot easier for non-technical users. They are part of the no-code movement to try to make web development more accessible, it does come with
                a charge which is why I chose not to use it. I like the idea of UI to generate UI, I think I may be copying it for an upcoming project.</p>

            <h1 id="why-i-use-linux">Why I use Linux</h1>
            <h2 id="like-all-things-we-will-start-in-the-beginning">Like all things we will start in the beginning</h2>
            <p>I'll set the scene, the year is 2013 at the time I am but a small zoomer of 15 years of age. around this time I was starting to write code (a story for another day) and the guy who was teaching me said &quot;Jake, if you are gonna take this
                seriously you need to get your own machine.&quot; My dad has worked in IT for as long as I can remember and he was always bringing old machines home with him, I asked him for a laptop and he provided.</p>
            <p>These machines were not of the highest quality and I was slightly tech literate, something that really doesn't run in the family. To continue to spark the love of technology my father thought it would be fun to not include an operating system
                and have me install windows by hand the next weekend ... I was not that patient. I went the to World Wide Web and googled &quot;Alternatives to Windows&quot;, I first found OSX (Mac OS), I also found out that you can't just throw it on
                to any computer ... not through lack of trying. The second name on the list was Ubuntu and an article on how to install it from a windows machine. &quot;Perfect&quot; I thought and thus we began down this rabbit hole</p>
            <h2 id="the-high-school-years">The High School Years</h2>
            <p>My highschool years were consumed by learning how to code, I was learning Java and C++ to make some cool stuff with robot and rocking Ye Olde Python 2 for basic data analytics. Throughout this time I was using the same laptop from back in
                the day, and I loved it.</p>
            <p>The reason I loved it was because using Linux made me different from my classmates, I was the weird kid with the computer that weighed more than most textbooks and with the weird looking operating systems. It made me look smart (I was not),
                it made me look rebellious (I was not) and it made look like a hacker (I was not). That new appearance have me a certain reverence from my classmates and I loved the individuality.</p>
            <p>The other reason why I loved Linux was because it was harder, now you may have read that and gone &quot;WOAH there buddy lets simmer down, this is a PG blog&quot; but let me explain myself. Everything on Linux (especially that long ago) was
                hard. I needed the Eclipse IDE, I struggled for it, I needed packages, I struggled to find them, I needed tools similar to what my classmates running windows were using, I struggled for them. These struggles became lessons and these lessons
                were learned and eventually compounded upon until I had a loose understanding of how computers, servers and the web worked.</p>
            <p>These ideas followed me into college where I planned to study computer science (for you know reasons)</p>
            <h2 id="collegiate-life">Collegiate Life</h2>
            <h3 id="at-the-time-that-i-am-writing-this-i-am-still-in-college-a-story-that-isnt-complete-yet-i-guess">At the time that I am writing this I am still in college, a story that isn't complete yet I guess</h3>
            <p>My first programming course in college was an intro to c++ class and in that class we only used Visual Studio. Visual Studios proper is not available on linux (which is a little ironic as I sit here and type this out in Visual Studio Code)
                as such I was forced to use windows for the entirety of my first year of college ... and it was weird, this was my first time using windows as a daily driver in nearly 4 years. A little bit into the first semester I did manage to get my
                hands on a junker of a laptop and threw Linux Mint XFCE on it. It was fun while it lasted but I have never been able to get into XFCE as a desktop environment it just looks too retro for me.</p>
            <p>Around this time I decided to take my linux elitism to a new level and ran Arch Linux with the Gnome desktop environment for nearly a year and a half before playing around with KDE. This brings me to another reason why I love linux, the customizability
                can allow my version of linux to look and act significantly different than your version of linux and thats great.</p>
            <h2 id="moving-forward">Moving forward</h2>
            <p>I really like linux I use it nearly everyday and any work that can be done in the operating is absolutely done in the operating system. My current laptop has 2 drives the 1 TB ssd runs linux there is a 250 gb HDD that is here for the sole
                purpose of having windows and some testing software on it</p>
